# Pointers, Arrays and Strings

## Description
This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming curriculum.  
It introduces the concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without Google:
- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- Differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use and manipulate strings
- Scope of variables

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with:
- All files should end with a new line
- Code should follow the **Betty style**
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Standard library functions (e.g. `printf`, `puts`, etc.) are forbidden, except where allowed
- `_putchar` is allowed (don’t push `_putchar.c`)

## Files
- `0-reset_to_98.c` – function that updates the value of a pointer to 98  
- `1-swap.c` – swaps the values of two integers  
- `2-strlen.c` – returns the length of a string  
- `3-puts.c` – prints a string followed by a new line  
- `4-print_rev.c` – prints a string in reverse  
- `5-rev_string.c` – reverses a string  
- `6-puts2.c` – prints every other character of a string  
- `7-puts_half.c` – prints the second half of a string  
- `8-print_array.c` – prints `n` elements of an array of integers  
- `9-strcpy.c` – copies a string to a buffer  
- `100-atoi.c` – converts a string to an integer  
- `main.h` – header file with all prototypes
