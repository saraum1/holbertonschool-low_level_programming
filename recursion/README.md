# Recursion Project

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming curriculum.  
It introduces recursion in C programming and includes several tasks that must be done without using loops.

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- gcc with the following flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Betty style for code and documentation
- No loops allowed
- No use of the C standard library (`printf`, `puts`, etc.)
- Allowed function: `_putchar`

## Files
- `main.h` → Header file with all function prototypes
- `0-puts_recursion.c` → Prints a string followed by a new line
- `1-print_rev_recursion.c` → Prints a string in reverse
- `2-strlen_recursion.c` → Returns the length of a string
- `3-factorial.c` → Returns the factorial of a number
- `4-pow_recursion.c` → Returns the value of x raised to the power of y
- `5-sqrt_recursion.c` → Returns the natural square root of a number
- `6-is_prime_number.c` → Checks if a number is a prime number

## Compilation
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using:
